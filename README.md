### Main Characters
---
- ***Jack (Player):*** A man in his late 40s who lives along with his daughter *Sarah* in their ragged old apartment near downtown New York City. He is currently suffering of a rare form of lung cancer but is unaware of his condition. He's an avid smoker and drinker. Years ago, his now ex-wife abandoned him for reasons he never understood. They were very happy together and had his daughter, which she left with him. It's his birthday today, and he doesn't plan to celebrate it. He's struggling to pay the bills regardless of his 3 part time jobs. Jack's life doesn't look very promising.

- ***Sarah:*** Jack's daughter, 12 years old, happy-go-lucky girl, who has a promising future due to her high intelligence and interest in the world of medicine, yet her living conditions impede her from getting a full education. She's only had her father throughout life as she's not one with many friends and is in fact an introvert.

## FAQ

- **How experienced are you at game development?**
    - I'm just a 15 year old student trying to learn. So far I have about 6 years of experience using Photoshop, but on the topic of actual programming, I only know how to code Arduino C and some basic coding knowledge. Apart from that, this will be my first attempt at a full game.

- **What's the expected release date?**
    - Honestly, any date I say would be a lie. But at this pace, I could say before June 2020. But anything is possible.
    
- **Why are you choosing to make this kind of game?**
    - I've always been a story teller in my own way. I like story based games. Games that have such a strong story, they can grip you like if you were watching a movie, or reading a good book. I've also always liked choices. To be able to make my own path anywhere I go, and in everything I do. Hence the choice making mechanic available in the game, as well as the story alongside it.
